COMP 3104 is a key part of the advanced curriculum, usually taken by students in Semester 5. Enrollment requires the completion of prerequisite courses such as UNIX Essentials (COMP 3044), ensuring that students have a solid foundation before tackling more complex topics. This course, together with others like Mobile Application Development and Applied Data Science, offers a comprehensive learning experience that prepares students for a wide range of career paths. Whether aiming to work in software development, DevOps engineering, or IT operations, students gain the skills needed to thrive in fast-paced, technology-driven industries. Through hands-on projects and real-world applications, COMP 3104 helps bridge the gap between academic learning and professional expertise.

Another essential aspect of DevOps is the cultural transformation it brings to organizations. In traditional development models, teams often work in silos, leading to miscommunication and delays. DevOps fosters a collaborative environment where developers and operations teams share responsibilities and objectives. This cultural shift helps organizations respond more quickly to customer needs, address issues early, and innovate faster. By adopting a DevOps culture, companies can ensure smoother project deliveries, more reliable software releases, and continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

Monitoring in DevOps is crucial for maintaining system performance and reliability. Key metrics like deployment frequency, lead time for changes, and mean time to recovery help teams evaluate the efficiency of their processes. By tracking these metrics, teams can identify areas for improvement, such as reducing the time it takes to fix issues. Monitoring tools, like Prometheus and Grafana, provide real-time insights into system health, ensuring that potential issues are addressed before they become critical. This approach leads to more stable software and improved customer satisfaction.
