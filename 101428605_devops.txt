COMP 3104 (DevOps) is a course designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to streamline the software development and deployment process by integrating development and IT operations. It covers key DevOps principles, such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and infrastructure as code. Throughout the course, students learn how to use essential tools like Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and monitoring solutions like Prometheus and the ELK Stack. With a strong emphasis on hands-on labs and projects, students are guided through the process of setting up CI/CD pipelines, containerizing applications, and automating infrastructure, all while ensuring security and scalability. By the end of the course, students will be well-versed in creating efficient, reliable, and secure software delivery pipelines, contributing to faster release cycles and improved collaboration between development and operations teams.
