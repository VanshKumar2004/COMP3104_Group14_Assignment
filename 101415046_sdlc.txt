Learning DevOps is becoming essential in today’s software development process because it makes everything flow more smoothly. Instead of developers writing code and then handing it over to operations teams to deploy—often causing delays or confusion—DevOps encourages these teams to work together from the start. This teamwork makes it easier to catch issues early and get feedback faster.

Another big plus is automation. With DevOps, tasks like testing or deploying software, which used to take a lot of time, can be automated. This not only speeds things up but also reduces the chance of human errors. Developers can make changes, and the system can automatically test and release those changes quickly.

Overall, DevOps helps teams deliver updates faster, improve software quality, and react quickly to customer needs, making it an important skill for anyone working in tech today.
