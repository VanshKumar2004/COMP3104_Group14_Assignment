Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle because it bridges the gap between development and operations, improving collaboration, speed, and product quality. Key benefits include:

Faster Delivery: Automation of testing, integration, and deployment reduces time-to-market.

Improved Collaboration: DevOps promotes a culture of shared responsibility, leading to better communication and fewer silos.

Higher Quality: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines ensure consistent code quality.

Reduced Failures: Early detection of issues and automated rollback mechanisms minimize downtime.

Scalability: Efficient infrastructure management and monitoring support smooth scaling of applications.
